    - Objective of the tracker: Collect, format, and make available 
        data from Country-by-Country Reports (CbCRs) disclosed by companies  
    - Why : facilitate access to CbCR data to all  
        - CbCRs data is instrumental for analyzing companies' tax
            practices  
        - CbCRs data is public but not centralized/standardized, 
        hence difficult to access  
        - Difficulty to access will grow as way more reports are 
        expected
